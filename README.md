# ConMan
A minimalistic and efficient contact manager in terminal.
This project is also aimed at making me more comfortable with C++ programming.

## Overview
ConMan is entirely terminal-based. It works with shortcuts to the main functionalities.

For example, pressing [n] in the main menu, lets you directly create a new contact.
Efficient, isn't it?

You don't even need to press Enter!
